# FluxShare

FluxShare is a decentralized payment automation platform built on IOTA blockchain that solves complex revenue sharing and subscription management challenges for digital businesses and creators.

## The Problem

Digital businesses, content creators, and collaborative teams face significant challenges:

- **Payment Distribution**: Manual splitting of revenue among team members, collaborators, or stakeholders is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Recurring Payments**: Managing subscriptions requires complex infrastructure and introduces high transaction fees
- **Financial Transparency**: Lack of verifiable payment history creates trust issues between parties
- **Payment Delays**: Traditional financial systems introduce delays in distributing funds to collaborators
- **High Fees**: Traditional payment processors charge substantial fees, especially for micro-transactions

## Our Solution

FluxShare leverages IOTA's feeless blockchain to automate multi-party payments and subscription management:

- **Automated Revenue Splitting**: Instantly divide incoming payments among multiple recipients based on predefined shares
- **Transparent Subscription Management**: Create, manage, and track subscription plans with complete transparency
- **Feeless Micro-Transactions**: Process even small payments efficiently without transaction fees
- **Real-Time Distribution**: Collaborators receive their share immediately when payment is received
- **Immutable Payment Records**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparent verification

## Primary Use Cases

- **Content Creators & Collaborators**: Automatically split revenue from subscriptions or one-time payments between creators, platforms, editors, and other contributors
- **SaaS & Digital Service Providers**: Manage subscription billing and divide revenue among development team, infrastructure providers, and investors
- **DAOs & Community Projects**: Distribute community funds transparently according to contribution or governance decisions
- **Freelance Teams**: Automatically allocate client payments across team members based on predefined work agreements
- **NFT Royalty Management**: Ensure ongoing royalty payments are properly distributed to all stakeholders

## Features

- **Smart Payment Splitting**: Automatically distribute funds among up to 10+ recipients with customizable share percentages
- **Subscription Management**: Create tiered subscription plans with flexible pricing and billing cycles
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track payment flows, subscription metrics, and revenue distribution in real-time
- **IOTA Blockchain Integration**: Leverage IOTA's secure, feeless transaction infrastructure
- **Programmable Payment Logic**: Create custom rules for different payment scenarios

## Deployed Smart Contracts

Our smart contracts have been successfully deployed to the IOTA blockchain:

| Contract Module | Description | Main Functions |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| `subscription_manager` | Manages subscription creation, payments, and renewal | `create_subscription`, `process_payment`, `renew_subscription` |
| `payment_splitter` | Handles automatic distribution of funds to multiple recipients | `split_payment`, `add_recipient`, `remove_recipient` |
| `subscription_registry` | Tracks active subscriptions and provides analytics | `register_subscription`, `get_transaction_history`, `get_analytics` |

**Deployment Information:**

## Interacting with Smart Contracts

### Creating a Subscription

```typescript
import { createSubscription } from '@/lib/iota/client';

// Create a new subscription plan
const subscription = await createSubscription({
  name: "Premium Plan",
  description: "Access to all premium features",
  price: BigInt(5000000), // 5 MIOTA
  duration: 30, // days
  ownerAddress: walletAddress
});
```

### Processing a Split Payment

```typescript
import { createSplitPayment } from '@/lib/iota/client';

// Define recipients and their shares
const recipients = [
  { address: "iota1abc...", share: 50 }, // 50%
  { address: "iota1def...", share: 30 }, // 30%
  { address: "iota1ghi...", share: 20 }  // 20%
];

// Process the payment split
const transactions = await createSplitPayment(
  kioskId,
  payerAddress, 
  recipients,
  BigInt(10000000), // 10 MIOTA
  { paymentId: "payment-123", description: "Monthly revenue" }
);
```

### Viewing Transaction History

```typescript
import { getTransactionHistory } from '@/lib/iota/client';

// Get transaction history for a subscription
const history = await getTransactionHistory(kioskId);
```

## Why IOTA Blockchain?

FluxShare leverages IOTA blockchain's unique advantages:

- **Zero Transaction Fees**: Makes micro-transactions and frequent payments economically viable
- **Fast Confirmations**: Near-instant payments ensure recipients get paid quickly
- **Scalability**: Handles high volumes of transactions without congestion
- **Energy Efficiency**: Uses significantly less energy than traditional blockchain networks
- **Secure and Immutable**: Provides tamper-proof records of all payment distributions

## Testing with Testnet Tokens

To test FluxShare on the IOTA Testnet:

1. Create an IOTA wallet using a compatible wallet provider
2. Request testnet tokens from the [IOTA Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.iota.cafe)
3. Connect your wallet to FluxShare using the "Connect Wallet" button
4. Create test subscriptions and payment splits to explore the functionality
